# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 16

**Evaluator: [Peykar, Jordan](mailto:jpeykar1@jhu.edu)**

### Features
* Modifications look good
* I think at least one of your extended features needs to be pulled into targeted features as there is probaly not enough non-CRUD

### UI sketches
* So much better. Good job

### Endpoint and/or other interface documentation
* No JSON in or out (-4 points)

### UML Class diagram
* Should have completed methods (ex. Student.favJob(JobListing)) (-1 point)
* Is JobType really necessary as it stands? I'm not saying take it out but you may want to build on this class to help you with matching
* UML is slightly disjoint from ui sketches but it is close enough that I can see what you are trying to do

### Architecture
* Described well. No image but I understand your stack

### Initial code
* Only really pasting a tutorial very little original code (-5 points)

#### Initial commit made
* Not all group members have commited to the repo (-1 point)

### Other General Remarks


**Grade: 89/100**
