# Iteration 6 Evaluation - Group 16 Matcha

### Presentation
(Was the presentation itself done well - was it well-organized, easy to understand, and convincing?)

Generally good.  Good answers to questions.

#### App demo
(Did app work well?  Did any errors arise during the demo?  How did the demo'd implementation line up with features proposed?)

Generally the demo went well.

You probably should have used a list data structure for strings.

You could have gotten further in terms of followup with the company.

#### UI quality based on the demo
(Was it well-designed? Was it usable?  Did it have glitches?)

Generally good, nice progress bar 

### Testing and Coverage
(Continue to write more tests for new features and keep high coverage?)

Test coverage is ok for non-frontend components.

### Build and Deployment and git usage
(Same as previous iterations)

Easy docker deployment, thanks!

### Non-CRUD feature
(How did it turn out?)

Matching and LinkedIn scraping were non-CRUD features..  you did the former but used a RESTful API for the latter.

You didn't end up writing much code for your non-CRUD aspects - in the end your app is primarily a database front-end.

### Iteration progress reporting
(Final CHANGELOG.md and project boards updated?)

Good work here.

### Evaluation of project difficulty
(in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion)

About average on difficulty and non-CRUD, almost all of the original proposed features were completed.

### Overall Remarks


**Grade: 88/100**
