# Iteration 3 Evaluation - Group 16

**Evaluator: [Peykar, Jordan](mailto:jpeykar1@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
* Looks like there is solid progress on the profile parsing
* No progress on the matching algorithm which is your main non-CRUD feature (-5)
* I can't really tell if your stack is up but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and took off the points for that.

### Design check-in
* Looks fine here no real issues

### Code Quality
* There should be a better file structure here. The backend is everywhere and should be in a subfolder (-2)
* Otherwise everything looks fine

### Git usage
* Something is wrong with github and commits are not displaying but it seems everyone is contributing

#### Use of the GitHub issue tracker to manage bugs, features, etc.
* Nothing to note

#### Codebase pushed to master on your team's GitHub repository for our inspection
* Nothing to note

### Iteration submission and reporting

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
* I couldn't build your project from the README
* There is clearly additional setup required. I could not get the virtual environment up even after going to its docs. A tip here would be to encapsulate ALL of the setup requirements in a script with docker deployment. (-2)

#### Top-level file CHANGELOG.md present in your repo and describes progress in this iteration well
* All good here

#### Use of GitHub's project boards to keep track of your progress
* Used but not projecting far enough in the future. You should fill out the project board for iterations 5 and 6 as well as 3 and 4 (-2)

### Other Remarks
#### Things to fix from this iteration:
* Matching Algorithm, It seems like almost all of it is from elsewhere, if you want to use that code cite it
* Better file structure needed
* Redo automated build, try doing it in an AWS instance so you can see what you need from scratch
* Fill project board with future iterations

**Grade: 89/100**
