### Implementation progress
[25 points]
* You guys are definitely behind, one of your extended features seems to not be working
* I'm not sure if your non-crud is enough, it seems like it just checks how many skills are in common then normalizes it. There needs to be something more to it (TFIDF?)
(-7 points)

#### Code Quality
[10 points]
* Looks fine here

### Testing
[20 points]
* Good test methodology

#### Test coverage
[10 points]
* Need to build out the rest of the tests for util since this contains most of your core functionality
* Views testing is covering only about half of your written endpoints
(-3 points)

#### Travis
[5 points]
* All good here

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points]
* All good here except I cannot run tests locally since the instructions given do not run them properly (project is in docker)

### Deployment
[5 points]
* Docker works

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points]
* Looks good here

### Iteration submission and reporting

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iterations 5 and 6
[10 points]
* No goals for iteration 6 (-5 points)

### Other Remarks


**Grade: 85/100**
